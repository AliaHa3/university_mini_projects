## Numerical Analyse Project

Project description
Numerical analyse project is a project for implementation of numerical analyse algorithms such Interpolation(Lagrange,Newton Gregory ,Spline ),Integration(Rectangles ,Trapezoid ,Simpson ),
Solve ordinary differential equations(Rong Cuta Fourth ,Uler), solve non-linear equations(Bisection).
with ability to draw the equations.
The project implemented using C# and Windows Form.
